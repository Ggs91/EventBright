## I - Informations

###  1. Backend
#### 1.1 Models and database structure
Currently there's 4 models: 
 - `User`: set for both regluar users of the app and administrators (with an `:admin` attribute set to `true`)
    - has one attached `avatar`
    - has many `administrated_events` (`Event` type)
    - has many `participations`
    - has many `attended_events` (`Event` type) through `participation`
 - `Event`: main subject resource
    - has many attached `images`
    - belongs to `administrator` (`User` type) 
    - has many `participations` 
    - has many `participants` (`User` type) through `participations`
    - has many `comments` as `commentable`
 - `Participation`: a user's participation to an event 
    - belongs to `user`
    - belongs to `event`
 - `Comment`: on events or other users comments
    - belongs to `commenter` (`User` type)
    - belongs to `commentable` (polymorphic)
    - has many `comments` as `commentable`


#### 1.2 Authentication (Devise)
I twisted the Devise configuration a little bit to allow users to use either email or username to sign in. Following the [Devise wiki](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/wiki/How-To:-Allow-users-to-sign-in-using-their-username-or-email-address) here's the few steps I've done: 
- Change the default authentication key to use `:login` instead of `:email`:
```ruby
# config/initializers/devise.rb

  config.authentication_keys = [:login]
```
- I made it mandatory to choose a username along with email & password during registration. So I had to permit it in strong parameters. Note: email also need to be explicitly permitted as well, it's no longer automatically permitted as it's not the default authentication key anymore.  
```ruby
# app/controllers/application_controller.rb

  def configure_permitted_parameters
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up,
      keys: [:email, :username]) 
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:account_update,
      keys: [:first_name, :last_name, :description, :email])
  end
```
- In the `User` model I've set a virtual attribute that will be used in the sign in form to hold the value of the crendential entered by the user (either email or username). I overwrote the `find_for_database_authentication` Devise class method to extend the default query to search for both credentials in the DB.

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb

  class User < ApplicationRecord
   attr_accessor :login

   ...

   def self.find_for_database_authentication warden_condition
     conditions = warden_condition.dup
     login = conditions.delete(:login)
     where(conditions).where(
       ["lower(username) = :value OR lower(email) = :value",
       { value: login.strip.downcase }]).first
   end
 end
``` 

#### 1.3 Authorization ([CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan))
Permissions are centralized in `app/models/ability.rb`. It enabled me to drastically DRY up the controllers by getting ride of many `before_action`s, and conveniently load a resource with the right permissions.

Here's some examples of permissions implemented: 

- Unauthenticated users can only access `event`'s `index` & `show` pages, but can't join it.
- Only `event`'s administrator can access the `event`'s profile (`show`) page if it's not validated by the (app) administrator yet. This is so an event's owner has still permission to updated or delete his event before it's published.
- Only validated `event`'s are displayed on the `index` page.
- Only `event`'s administrator can access `participant`s list.

#### 1.4 Admin dashboard ([Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate))
The admin dashboard is accessible under the "/admin" namespace. You can login as an admin with these credentials: `username: admin, password: password`.

When an event is newly created, it has its `validated` attribute set to `false`. It's not displayed on the index pages, and only its creator has permission to access the event `show` page in order to update or delete it. To be validated, an admin has to do it manually through the admin dashboard.

#### 1.4 Payment system ([Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/development))

Event can either be free or paying. To checkout for paying events, enter testing card infos in the checkout form: 

- Card nÂ° `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiry date: any date in the future e.g. `12/25`
- CVV: any 3 digits e.g. `123`

#### 1.4 Mailer (Action Mailer)

Emails are sent after specific actions: 
- welcome email: when a user create an account
- summarizing email: when a participation is created to summarize the event infos, `star_date`, `administrator` and number of `participants`. 

There are both text and html templates.

#### 1.5 Image upload (Active Storage & Cloudinary)

Cloudinary is used for hosting images and storing uploaded images. 
I use Active Storage for uploading images directly from the client to the cloud service. 

An interesting part was the work on the seed with this configuration. I had to find a way to minimize API calls to the server and make sure each `event` doesn't get the same image twice for both a better seed and because there is a uniqueness constraint on the `active_storage_attachments` table, so it is not possible to attach the same blob twice to an `event`.

I had 15 images stored on Cloudinary that I wanted to use for seeding the `event` images (each `event` has 3 attached images). First I attached an image individually to each event like this:
```ruby
# seed.rb

# Storing images paths in an array:

  images = [
    io: open("https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudfilestorage/image/upload/v1616230747/eventbrite/travel_group_ur803j.jpg"), filename: 'travel_group.jpg', content_type: 'image/jpg',
    io: open("https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudfilestorage/image/upload/v1614553355/eventbrite/party_wtsqnk.jpg"), filename: 'party.jpg', content_type: 'image/jpg',
    io: open("https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudfilestorage/image/upload/v1614549002/eventbrite/conference_y7qiyn.jpg"), filename: 'conference.jpg', content_type: 'image/jpg'
    ...
    # 15 images paths on the cloud
  ]

 # Attaching 3 images per event: 

  3.times do 
    event.images.attach(images[rand[0..15]])
  end
``` 

But I faced a 2 problems with the line `event.images.attach(images[rand[0..15]])`:

- Each time the `#attach` method is used, it is actually re-uploading the image to Cloudinary before creating a blob for this image and attaching it to the event. This means if I wanted to seed 30 `event`s I would have 90 (30 * 3) uploads happening & unnecessary duplicated images stored on the cloud. 
- This is too much API calls to the server and Cloudinary was blocking my requests

After some research I found a way to separate the processes (blob creation & blob attachement) that are automatically done by the `#attach` method:

```ruby 
# seed.rb

  image_blobs = [
    ActiveStorage::Blob.create_after_upload!(io: open("https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudfilestorage/image/upload/v1616230747/eventbrite/travel_group_ur803j.jpg"), filename: 'travel_group.jpg', content_type: 'image/jpg'),
    ActiveStorage::Blob.create_after_upload!(io: open("https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudfilestorage/image/upload/v1614553355/eventbrite/party_wtsqnk.jpg"), filename: 'party.jpg', content_type: 'image/jpg'),
    ActiveStorage::Blob.create_after_upload!(io: open("https://res.cloudinary.com/cloudfilestorage/image/upload/v1614553355/eventbrite/boxe_zub0uu.jpg"), filename: 'boxe.jpg', content_type: 'image/jpg'),

... # 15 times

```
The `ActiveStorage::Blob.create_after_upload!` uploads the images to the cloud and create a blob referencing this image. Now I have an array that contain 15 blobs referencing 15 images, that are uploaded once and for all to the cloud. I can now have more control over the attachement process. 

But I faced another problem with the file attachment: 

```ruby
  3.times do 
    event.images.attach(image_blobs[rand[0..15]])
  end
```
Since the `image_blobs` array contains 15 single instances of blobs, and I was picking randomly 3 blobs out of those same 15, it means a same blob can get attached twice for the same `event`. I was getting an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique` error because there is a uniqueness constraint on the `active_storage_attachments` table. I found a simple way to work around this problem:

```ruby
  event.images.attach(image_blobs[0..8].sample)
  event.images.attach(image_blobs[9..11].sample)
  event.images.attach(image_blobs[12..14].sample)
```
Now I make sure each `event` doesn't get the same image twice, and this also have the advantage of forcing more diversity regarding the images displayed.
